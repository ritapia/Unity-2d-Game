# Unity-2d-Game

This is a 2d platform game I wrote using Unity. The premise is that the world was taken over by robots. You are playing a soldier who was sent to infiltrate the robot's main base of operations to put an end to this war.

Scripts written for this game are under Assets/Scripts

Here is a video of the game: https://thumbs.gfycat.com/FemaleDefenselessBullmastiff-mobile.mp4
